.SH NAME
pam_saslauthd \- check and set passwords using SASL

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B auth sufficient @libdir@/security/pam_saslauthd.so [\fIargs\fP]
.br
.B password required @libdir@/security/pam_saslauthd.so

.SH DESCRIPTION
pam_saslauthd checks user passwords using libsasl2, which can be configured to use
an auxprop database such as sasldb.  Using this module should allow "passwd" to
perform the same function as "saslpasswd", and work properly for unprivileged
users as well.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP realm=\fBREALM\fP
authenticate users in a realm other than the default (the default is selected
by libsasl2).
.IP service=\fBSERVICE\fP
uses a service other than the default (which is the PAM service the module is
being called by, i.e., \fIlogin\fP or \fIftp\fP).  \fBNOTE:\fP if you do not
use this option, and do not override the \fIpwcheck_method\fP setting in a the
\fI/usr/lib/sasl2/\fBSERVICE\fP.conf\fR file, then libsasl2 may attempt to use
\fIsaslauthd\fP to authenticate the user, and if \fIsaslauthd\fP is in turn
configured to use PAM, bad things will happen.
.IP use_first_pass
when authenticating users or checking passwords as part of a password change
operation, use the password read by an earlier module in the stack, and fail if
it is not correct.
.IP try_first_pass
when authenticating users or checking passwords as part of a password change
operation, try the password read by an earlier module in the stack, and prompt
the user for one if one was not set.
.IP use_authtok
when changing passwords, use the value for the new password which was read by
an earlier module in the stack rather than asking the user.

Let's hope not, but if you find any, please report them to the author.
